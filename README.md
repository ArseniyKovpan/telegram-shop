# Telegram store
Used: PyTelegramApi, Sqllite, Python 3.9.10.
#
Telegram store with DB and PAYMENT
#
Folder "static", contains imgs
#
Since this is a prototype, there are only two files "main.py" and "cfg.py" in the "main" folder.
“cfg.py” stores the bot’s personal token and currently goods (in the future they will be stored in db).
#
I'll optimize this project in the future.
